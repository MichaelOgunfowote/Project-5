                    <p>Bright-Hills Academy School was established in <b><em>2003</em></b> registered and approved by the Ogun State Ministry of Education (OSME), and Corperate Affairs Commission (CAC) starting with Bright-Hills Academy Nursery and Primary School, Ogun State. In <b><i>2015</i></b>,  Bright-Hills Academy Secondary School was established, some of our parents have been clamouring for the establishment of a secondary school to enable their wards continue to benefit from the role model building programme of the school. Little wonder then that many of the pioneer students of the High School were products of the Primary School. The trend continues till date. </p>
